Step 1: Understand Cloud Service Models

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
•	Provides basic computing infrastructure
•	Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine
•	Use case: When you need full control over OS and infrastructure

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
•	Provides platform for developing and deploying applications
•	Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
•	Use case: When developers want to focus on code without managing servers

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
•	Ready-to-use software applications
•	Examples: Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft 365
•	Use case: When you need applications without any maintenance

Step 2: Explore Cloud Deployment Models

1. Public Cloud
•	Owned by cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
•	Best for: Startups, scalable applications
2. Private Cloud
•	Dedicated to a single organization
•	Best for: Highly regulated industries (banking, healthcare)
3. Hybrid Cloud
•	Combines public and private clouds
•	Best for: Businesses needing both security and scalability
4. Multi-cloud
•	Uses multiple cloud providers
•	Best for: Avoiding vendor lock-in, redundancy

Step 3: Hands-on Practice
Basic Cloud Exercises
1.	Create a Virtual Machine (IaaS)
o	AWS: Launch an EC2 instance
o	Azure: Create a virtual machine
o	GCP: Spin up a Compute Engine instance
2.	Store a File in Cloud Storage
o	AWS: Upload to S3 bucket
o	Azure: Store in Blob Storage
o	GCP: Use Cloud Storage
3.	Deploy a Simple Web App (PaaS)
o	AWS: Use Elastic Beanstalk
o	Azure: Deploy to App Service
o	GCP: Try App Engine
Tip: Use free tiers to avoid costs.

Step 4: Apply Knowledge to Business Cases
•	How could cloud computing benefit your current projects?
•	What cost savings could be achieved by moving to the cloud?
•	How could cloud services improve team collaboration?

Next Steps
•	Explore free cloud training from AWS/Azure/GCP
•	Consider cloud certifications (AWS Cloud Practitioner, Azure Fundamentals)
•	Experiment with more advanced services (containers, serverless)
